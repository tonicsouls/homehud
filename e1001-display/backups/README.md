Backup save point folder

This folder contains a timestamped backup of `src/main.cpp` created as a save point before flashing and edits.

Files:
- main.cpp.backup-2025-12-01-0000.cpp — main.cpp copy with header

Guidance:
- If you want to restore the saved state, copy the .cpp file back to `src/main.cpp`.
- Consider using git for formal versioning if you don't already.
